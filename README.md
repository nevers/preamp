The Preamp

The aim of this project is to create a yet high fidelity stereo pre-amplifier. It is designed to provide comfort features such as IR remote control and an LCD display without compromising the audio quality.

The IO of the device is very simple:
 Six independenly selectable stereo inputs.
 Two identical stereo outputs.
